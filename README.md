# kuali

## Purpose
Kuali Time only allows you to see 2 weeks' worth of hours at a time, so I wrote this web scraper so that I could generate a csv of my hours for the entire year and generate my own plots and insights into my hours.

## Contents
- scraper.py: the python file that does all of the web navigation and scraping
- hours.html: HTML manually downloaded from Kuali that was used to write the scraping code
- All Hours.csv: the resultant csv from running the python file consisting of all dates and hours taken off Kuali Time
- other csv files: the code also records each 2 week period in its own csv
